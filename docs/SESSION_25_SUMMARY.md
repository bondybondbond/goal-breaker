### 3. New MoSCoW Prioritization
**Created:** `docs/MOSCOW_PRIORITIZATION_V2.md`

**Key Changes from Old Backlog:**
- ✂️ **TIGHT** focus - Only 3 MUST haves, 3 SHOULD haves
- 📊 **Phased roadmap** - Clear 4-week plan with effort estimates
- 🚫 **Clear WON'Ts** - Explained why we're not doing 6+ items
- 🎯 **Realistic** - Based on current SimpleGoalBreaker state

---

## 📋 New Priorities (At a Glance)

### 🔥 MUST (Week 1 - 8 hours total)
1. **Canvas panning** (spacebar + middle mouse) - 2h
2. **Card selection + delete** - 3h  
3. **Mark as complete** (green + strikethrough) - 2h
4. **Helper text system** (already extracted!) - 1h

### 💪 SHOULD (Week 2 - 11 hours)
5. **Keyboard shortcuts** (Tab/Enter) - 4h
6. **Save/Load** (localStorage + menu) - 7h

### 💎 POLISH (Week 3 - 10 hours)
7. **90-degree connectors** - 4h
8. **Arrow improvements** - 2h
9. **Visual polish** - 1h

### 🎨 COULD (Week 4+)
- Zoom feature
- Priority system  
- Dark mode

### 🚫 WON'T DO (Explained in doc)
- Mermaid import/export (too complex, niche)
- Multiple file types (over-engineering)
- List view + code editor (duplicates canvas)
- Linking goals across levels (unclear UX)
- Assumptions drawer (unclear value)
- Board titles (trivial, can wait)

---

## 🚀 Immediate Next Steps

**Right Now (This Session):**
1. ✅ Archives protected from Git
2. ✅ Old files purged
3. ✅ New roadmap created
4. ⬜ **Start Phase 1:** Integrate CanvasManager for panning

**Next Session:**
- Complete Phase 1 (selection, delete, complete, helper text)
- 8 hours of focused work = Core usability complete

## 📊 Why This MoSCoW is Better

### Old Backlog Problems:
- 15+ features listed without clear priority
- Mix of easy wins and complex projects
- No effort estimates
- Unclear what was already done
- Too many "nice to haves" that clutter

### New MoSCoW Benefits:
- **TIGHT:** Only 9 features total across MUST/SHOULD/COULD
- **REALISTIC:** Effort estimates based on existing code
- **PHASED:** Clear week-by-week roadmap
- **FOCUSED:** Cuts 6+ features with explanations
- **ACTIONABLE:** Start with 8-hour Phase 1

---

## 💡 Key Insights

1. **SimpleGoalBreaker is very basic** - Missing selection, panning, delete, save, keyboard shortcuts
2. **Low-hanging fruit identified** - CanvasManager + Helper text already built, just integrate
3. **Clear WON'Ts** - Explained why Mermaid/multi-format/list view aren't worth it
4. **80/20 principle applied** - Phase 1 = 8 hours = Usable app
5. **Learning focus** - You're building PM skills, not just an app

---

**Confidence: 10/10** - Archives protected, old cruft purged, tight roadmap created with realistic estimates

**Next Action:** Ready to start Phase 1, Feature 1: Canvas panning! 🚀
