# Goal Breaker Development Log

## Recent Changes

### Movement Controls Implementation (September 2025)
**Features Added:**
- ✅ Middle mouse button panning (Figma-style)
- ✅ Spacebar + mouse panning (Figma-style) 
- ✅ Removed left mouse button panning (too many options)
- ✅ Smart signpost tutorial hints when panning
- ✅ Editing mode protection (spacebar won't pan when typing in text fields)

**Technical Implementation:**
- Modified `handleCanvasMouseDown` to only respond to middle mouse button (button 1)
- Enhanced `handleCanvasMouseMove` to handle both middle mouse and spacebar panning
- Updated `handleCanvasKeyUp` to reset pan state when spacebar released
- Extended floating helper text to show navigation instructions during panning
- Maintained existing editing safeguards to prevent accidental panning during text input

**User Experience:**
- Movement now feels like Figma with intuitive navigation controls
- Clean, focused panning options without overwhelming choices
- Contextual help appears when users discover panning features
- Protected text editing experience without interference

## Next Priority Items
Based on PRD and user feedback:
1. UI polish and visual improvements
2. Export/import functionality refinements
3. Performance optimizations
4. Additional celebration/feedback systems

## Known Issues
- Need to verify smooth performance on larger goal structures
- Canvas alignment after switching between list/canvas views may need tuning
