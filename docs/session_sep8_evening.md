### 🎯 Feature Implementation: Deletion Confirmation Dialog
**Goal:** Add confirmation dialog when users click "X" to delete goals
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED - Ready for Testing

### ⚙️ Technical Implementation:

**1. Enhanced `deleteGoal()` function in `GoalBreakdown/index.tsx`:**
- Added goal lookup to get context about the goal being deleted
- Implemented intelligent confirmation messages based on goal type and structure
- Added cascade deletion warnings when goals have children
- Used `window.confirm()` for native browser confirmation dialog

**2. Confirmation Message Logic:**
- **Main Goals (level 0):** "Are you sure you want to delete this main goal?"
- **Sub-tasks with name:** "Are you sure you want to delete '[Task Name]'?"
- **With children:** Warns "This will also delete X sub-task(s)."
- **Unnamed tasks:** "Are you sure you want to delete 'this task'?"

**3. Safety Features:**
- Only deletes after explicit user confirmation
- Shows impact of cascading deletions
- Provides context with task names when available
- Works in both Canvas and List views

### 🧪 Expected User Experience:
1. User clicks "X" button on any goal
2. Confirmation dialog appears with contextual message
3. If goal has children, warns about cascading deletion
4. User must click "OK" to proceed or "Cancel" to abort
5. Deletion only happens after confirmation

### 🔐 Protection Levels:
- **All deletions** require confirmation (no accidental deletions)
- **Main goals** have special protection messaging
- **Cascading deletions** show warning about affected sub-tasks
- **Named tasks** show actual task name for better context

### ✅ Implementation Complete:
- Modified single function with comprehensive confirmation logic
- Maintains existing deletion behavior after confirmation
- No UI changes needed - uses native browser dialogs
- Works consistently across Canvas and List views

### 📋 Backlog Status Update:
- ✅ **MUST HAVE: Ask to confirm each delete, especially main goal** - COMPLETED
- Next priority: Address remaining bugs from backlog

### 🎯 Ready for User Testing:
Feature is implemented and ready for testing. User should create some goals with sub-tasks and test the deletion confirmation in both views.
