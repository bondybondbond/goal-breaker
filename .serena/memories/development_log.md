# Development Log - Goal Breaker

## Recent Session (Sept 16, 2025)

### Bugs Fixed:
1. **Middle-mouse click bug** - Fixed in `GoalCard.tsx`
   - Problem: Middle-click on goal cards moved the card instead of panning canvas
   - Solution: Added check for `e.button !== 0` to only handle left-clicks for dragging
   - File: `src/components/GoalCard.tsx` - modified `handleMouseDown` function

2. **Direction toggle color improvement** - Fixed in `index.tsx`
   - Problem: Blue buttons had poor contrast with blue arrow emojis
   - Solution: Changed to mint green (emerald) color scheme for fresh, modern look
   - Added: "Direction" label with separator line for clarity
   - File: `src/components/GoalBreakdown/index.tsx` - modified direction toggle section
   - Final color choice: **Mint green** - selected after testing peach, grey, and mint options
   - Active state: `bg-emerald-100 text-emerald-900 shadow-sm border border-emerald-200`
   - Hover state: `hover:text-emerald-800 hover:bg-emerald-50`

### Major Refactoring:
3. **AppNavigation.tsx extraction** - MAJOR CODE CLEANUP
   - Problem: Main file was 1,101 lines (3-10x too big for React component)
   - Solution: Extracted all navigation/header components into separate file
   - Files: 
     - Created: `src/components/AppNavigation.tsx` (174 lines)
     - Modified: `src/components/GoalBreakdown/index.tsx` (933 lines, down from 1,101)
   - **Result**: 15% reduction in main file size, much cleaner architecture
   - **Components extracted**: Header, direction controls, view toggles, menu overlay, action buttons
   - **Clean separation**: Navigation UI vs Core app logic
   - **Future-proof**: Components can be repositioned independently as app evolves

### Technical Notes:
- Mouse button codes: 0 = left, 1 = middle, 2 = right
- Mint green provides excellent contrast with blue arrow emojis (⬅️➡️⬇️)
- Added `handleViewChange` function to manage canvas view switching logic
- AppNavigation receives props for all state it needs, maintaining clean separation
- Main component now much more focused on core goal management logic

### Architecture Improvements:
- Single responsibility principle: Navigation components separated from core logic
- Better maintainability: Navigation changes won't affect core app logic
- Cleaner file structure: 933 lines is much more manageable than 1,101
- Improved readability: Main component focuses on business logic, not UI

## Current Session (Sept 21, 2025) - CRITICAL TEXT EDITING BUG

### Issue Summary:
- **Primary**: Cannot edit ultimate goal text in canvas view (works in list view)
- **Secondary**: Direction changes require list view toggle to work

### Major Fixes Completed:
1. **Infinite Loop Elimination**:
   - Removed `goals` from repositioning useEffect dependency array
   - Eliminated setTimeout calls causing repositioning cycles
   - Fixed `slotSpacing is not defined` JavaScript error

2. **State Management Improvements**:
   - Enhanced `calculateCascadingSlots` to preserve `isEditing` state
   - Added `hasEditingGoals` check to prevent repositioning during editing
   - Implemented `setGoalsDebug` wrapper for state change tracking

3. **Debugging Infrastructure**:
   - Comprehensive logging throughout editing pipeline
   - Stack trace capture for `isEditing` state changes
   - Enhanced repositioning check logging

### Current Status:
- **Working**: Direction changes, view switching, list view editing
- **Broken**: Canvas view text editing (isEditing gets reset mysteriously)

### Next Priority Bugs:
- **CRITICAL**: Canvas text editing (ultimate goal)
- Overlaps issue (medium priority)
- Celebration zoom/spin levels
- Text editing surface area mismatch

### Future Refactoring Opportunities:
- ConnectionManager.tsx (connection calculation logic)
- Canvas event handlers (130 lines of complex logic)
- Goal management functions (could be custom hook)
