# Development Log - Goal Breaker

## Recent Session Changes

### 2025-01-25: Card Selection Visual Fixes

#### Issue 1: Selection Effects ✅ FIXED
Removed unwanted visual scaling, borders, shadows, and pulse animations during card selection.

#### Issue 2: Text Alignment Consistency ❌ REVERTED
**Problem**: Text alignment inconsistent between editing/display modes.
**Decision**: Reverted to functional state - display text center-aligned, editing text top-aligned with scroll bars for proper UX.

#### Issue 3: Selection Visibility ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: No clear visual indication of selected card (only plus buttons showed selection).

**Solution**: Added subtle selection indicator:
- **Selected cards**: Thin colored border (2px) matching level color
- **Non-selected cards**: Standard gray border
- **Color coding**: Yellow for main goals, blue for level 1, purple for level 2, etc.

**Implementation**: Modified border styling in GoalCard component:
- `isSelected ? 'border-2 ${selectionColor.bg.replace('bg-', 'border-')}' : 'border border-gray-200'`

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/GoalBreakdown/index.tsx` - GoalCard border styling

#### Current Status:
- ✅ Selection effects cleaned up
- ✅ Selection visibility restored with subtle indicator
- ✅ Text editing functionality preserved
- ⏳ Ready for user testing of selection indicator

**Next**: Test selection visibility across different level cards.
