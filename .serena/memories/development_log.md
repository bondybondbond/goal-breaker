# Goal Breaker Development Log

## Recent Changes

### Movement Controls Implementation - COMPLETED ✅ (September 8, 2025)
**Commit**: `f9ab97e1` - "Add Figma-style movement controls - spacebar and middle mouse panning with cursor feedback"

**Features Added:**
- ✅ Middle mouse button panning (Figma-style)
- ✅ Spacebar + mouse panning (Figma-style) 
- ✅ Removed left mouse button panning (too many options - cleaner UX)
- ✅ Smart signpost tutorial hints when panning
- ✅ Editing mode protection (spacebar won't pan when typing in text fields)
- ✅ Clean helper text: "Hold **Spacebar** or **Middle mouse button** + drag to pan"
- ✅ CSS cursor styling with grab/grabbing feedback

**Technical Implementation:**
- Modified `handleCanvasMouseDown` to only respond to middle mouse button (button 1)
- Enhanced `handleCanvasMouseMove` to handle both middle mouse and spacebar panning
- Updated `handleCanvasKeyUp` to reset pan state when spacebar released
- Extended floating helper text to show navigation instructions during panning
- Added CSS overrides in `src/index.css` for cursor styling
- Maintained existing editing safeguards to prevent accidental panning during text input

**User Experience:**
- Movement now feels like Figma with intuitive navigation controls
- Clean, focused panning options without overwhelming choices
- Contextual help appears when users discover panning features
- Protected text editing experience without interference

**Deployment:**
- Successfully pushed to GitHub: `https://github.com/bondybondbond/goal-breaker.git`
- Auto-deployed to Vercel production

## Next Priority Items
Based on PRD and user feedback (in priority order):
1. **UI Polish & Visual Improvements** - Better design, buttons with fresh visual effects
2. **Export/Import Functionality Refinements** - Enhanced Mermaid support
3. **Performance Optimizations** - Smooth experience with larger goal structures
4. **Celebration/Feedback Systems** - Confetti and motivational features
5. **Save Goals Feature** - Persistent storage with hamburger menu

## Known Issues
- Cursor color sometimes shows as white instead of colored (browser-specific, low priority)
- Canvas alignment after switching between list/canvas views may need tuning
- Need to verify smooth performance on larger goal structures

## Development Notes
- User prefers one change at a time for testing and validation
- Focus on 80/20 rule - simple implementations with maximum impact
- Follow problem-first approach, not feature-driven development
- Always update this log after successful feature milestones
