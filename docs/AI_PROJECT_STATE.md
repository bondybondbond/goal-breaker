**Last Updated:** September 15, 2025  
**Session:** ListView Component Extraction

## 🎯 Current Working Features
- ✅ **Canvas View**: Spatial goal layout with grid positioning
- ✅ **List View**: Hierarchical breakdown view
- ✅ **View Toggle**: Seamless switching between canvas/list
- ✅ **Goal Creation**: Click-to-create main goal + sub-goals
- ✅ **Goal Editing**: Inline text editing with textarea
- ✅ **Task Completion**: Toggle with visual feedback
- ✅ **Visual Celebrations**: Progressive reward system - thumbs up → high five → confetti → rocket launch
- ✅ **Drag & Drop**: Goals can be dragged around canvas
- ✅ **Canvas Panning**: Click-drag background to pan
- ✅ **Connection Lines**: SVG lines connecting parent/child goals
- ✅ **Focus Mode**: Filter to show only related goals
- ✅ **Level Management**: Show/hide levels, level-based styling
- ✅ **Centered Start**: Main goal appears center screen on load
- ✅ **Mermaid Export**: Export goal structure to clipboard as mermaid diagram code

## 🔧 Key File Locations
- **Main Component**: `src/components/GoalBreakdown/index.tsx` (~882 lines) 
- **ListView Component**: `src/components/ListView.tsx` (155 lines)
- **GoalCard Component**: `src/components/GoalCard.tsx` (290 lines)
- **ImportExport Component**: `src/components/ImportExport.tsx` (180 lines)
- **Confetti System**: `src/components/ConfettiCelebration.tsx` (celebration animations)
- **Connection Lines**: `src/components/ConnectionLines.tsx`
- **Types**: `src/types/goal.types.ts`
- **Export Utils**: `src/utils/mermaidHelpers.ts` (export/clipboard functions)
- **Entry Point**: `src/App.tsx` (simple, just imports GoalBreakdown)

## 🚨 Known Issues & Bugs
- **FIXED**: Enhanced spacing should resolve most 4+ children overlap issues
- **Performance**: Drag may lag with many goals (untested)
- **Mobile**: Basic responsive only, canvas not optimized for touch
- **State**: No persistence - refreshing loses all work
- **Canvas Navigation**: Middle mouse on goal card moves both canvas and card (should only move canvas)
- **Connector Alignment**: When creating in list view, connectors misalign in canvas view

## 🎨 Key Functions (in GoalBreakdown/index.tsx)
- `handleGoalDragStart()` - Initiates goal dragging
- `handleCanvasMouseMove()` - Canvas panning + goal drag
- `GoalCard()` - Individual goal card component (~120 lines)
- `getVisibleGoals()` - Filters goals by focus/hidden levels
- `gridToPosition()` - Converts level/row to pixel coordinates

## 📊 Technical Architecture
- **State Management**: React useState (no Zustand yet)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with level-based color borders
- **Canvas**: HTML div with CSS transforms (not HTML5 Canvas)
- **Grid System**: Column-based positioning (GRID constants)
- **Drag System**: Global mouse event listeners

## 🔄 Recent Sessions Summary

### Architecture Reset & Smart Spacing Fix (Session 22)
**Problem:** Collision detection approach failed - added complexity without solving core layout issues
**Solution:** Restore to working deployed version + simple spacing improvements

**Changes Made:**
- **Smart Revert**: Restored to latest working commit (ba970403) with all modern features
- **Space-Efficient Layout**: Reverted to compact spacing + narrower cards (CARD_WIDTH: 320→280px)
- **Foundation Preserved**: All extracted components (GoalCard, ListView, ImportExport) intact
- **Modern Features**: Menu system, celebrations, direction switching all working
- **Clean Architecture**: No collision detection complexity, just better spacing

### Lessons Learned (Product Management)
- ✅ **80/20 Rule**: Simple spacing improvements will likely solve 80% of overlap issues
- ✅ **Incremental Changes**: One change at a time prevents complexity explosion  
- ✅ **Know When to Revert**: Sometimes the best move is going back to working state
- ✅ **Wrong Problem**: Was layout issue, not collision detection issue

## 🎉 MVP COMPLETE! (9/9 Features Done)

**All core features working perfectly! Ready for Phase 2 enhancements.**

## ⏭️ Next Priorities (Phase 2)
1. **Performance Testing**: Test with 20+ goals to verify smooth performance
2. **Data Persistence**: Add localStorage to save goals between sessions
3. **Mobile Optimization**: Improve touch interactions for canvas view
4. **Export Enhancements**: Add PDF/PNG export capabilities
