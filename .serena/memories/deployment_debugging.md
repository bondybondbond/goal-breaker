# Deployment Debugging Session

## Issue
- App builds successfully on Vercel but shows blank screen
- Works perfectly in local development
- Build logs show no errors

## Investigation Steps Taken
1. **Created minimal test component** - worked locally but still blank on deployment
2. **Checked build output** - found favicon.ico reference in built index.html but no favicon file
3. **Cleaned up public/index.html** - removed commented favicon reference, updated title
4. **Still blank after fixes**

## Current Status
- Issue remains unresolved
- Full GoalBreaker component restored to App.tsx
- Ready for future debugging session

## Next Debugging Steps to Try
1. Check browser console errors on deployed site (F12 â†’ Console)
2. Check Network tab for failed resource loads
3. Try different Vercel build settings
4. Check if Tailwind CSS is loading properly in production
5. Consider adding error boundaries to catch runtime errors
6. Test with production build locally: `npm run build && npx serve -s build`

## Files Modified During Session
- `public/index.html` - cleaned up, removed favicon reference
- `src/App.tsx` - temporarily used test component, then restored GoalBreaker
- `src/App.test.tsx` - created minimal test component

## Potential Causes Still to Investigate
- Tailwind CSS not loading in production
- Missing environment variables
- JavaScript runtime errors in production build
- Vercel configuration issues
- Build tool compatibility issues
