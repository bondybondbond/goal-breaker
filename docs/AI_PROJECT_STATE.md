## 🔧 Key File Locations
- **Main Component**: `src/components/GoalBreakdown/index.tsx` (~882 lines) 
- **ListView Component**: `src/components/ListView.tsx` (155 lines)
- **GoalCard Component**: `src/components/GoalCard.tsx` (290 lines)
- **ImportExport Component**: `src/components/ImportExport.tsx` (180 lines)
- **Confetti System**: `src/components/ConfettiCelebration.tsx` (celebration animations)
- **Connection Lines**: `src/components/ConnectionLines.tsx`
- **Types**: `src/types/goal.types.ts`
- **Export Utils**: `src/utils/mermaidHelpers.ts` (export/clipboard functions)
- **Entry Point**: `src/App.tsx` (simple, just imports GoalBreakdown)

## 🚨 Known Issues & Bugs
- **🔴 CRITICAL**: Duplicate goal cards being created in complex PPTGoalBreaker component
- **🔴 CRITICAL**: PowerPoint SmartArt positioning logic incomplete - horizontal/vertical growth rules wrong
- **Position Logic Bug**: Cards overlapping - need proper grid-based PowerPoint SmartArt algorithm
- **Performance**: Drag may lag with many goals (untested)
- **Mobile**: Basic responsive only, canvas not optimized for touch
- **State**: No persistence - refreshing loses all work
- **Canvas Navigation**: Middle mouse on goal card moves both canvas and card (should only move canvas)

## 🎨 Key Functions (in GoalBreakdown/index.tsx)
- `handleGoalDragStart()` - Initiates goal dragging
- `handleCanvasMouseMove()` - Canvas panning + goal drag
- `GoalCard()` - Individual goal card component (~120 lines)
- `getVisibleGoals()` - Filters goals by focus/hidden levels
- `gridToPosition()` - Converts level/row to pixel coordinates

## 📊 Technical Architecture
- **State Management**: React useState (no Zustand yet)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with level-based color borders
- **Canvas**: HTML div with CSS transforms (not HTML5 Canvas)
- **Grid System**: Column-based positioning (GRID constants)
- **Drag System**: Global mouse event listeners

## 🔄 Recent Sessions Summary

### Duplicate Cards Bug Hunt - Strip & Rebuild (Session 24/09/25)
**Problem:** Persistent duplicate cards bug in PPTGoalBreaker component
**Strategy:** Strip down to minimal version, add complexity back one feature at a time

**Progress Made:**
- ✅ **Bug Isolated**: Created SimpleGoalBreaker.tsx - NO duplicates with basic state management
- ✅ **Root Cause Found**: Duplicate bug is in PPTGoalBreaker's complex features, NOT in React state
- ✅ **Basic Positioning**: Added simple grid positioning - still no duplicates
- ✅ **Grid Layout**: Added PowerPoint SmartArt-style grid system - no duplicates
- 🔄 **PowerPoint Logic**: Attempted deepest-level vertical/horizontal rules - partially working

**Key Discovery:** 
- React state management is perfect - useState/setGoals works flawlessly
- Bug lives in complex features: positioning calculations, celebrations, canvas panning, etc.
- Simple components work perfectly - complexity breeds bugs

**Current State:**
- SimpleGoalBreaker.tsx works perfectly (no duplicates, clean positioning)
- PPTGoalBreaker.tsx still has duplicate bug (not currently active)
- PowerPoint SmartArt logic 70% complete - needs horizontal/vertical rule refinement

## 🔄 Previous Sessions Summary

### Architecture Reset & Smart Spacing Fix (Session 22)
**Problem:** Collision detection approach failed - added complexity without solving core layout issues
**Solution:** Restore to working deployed version + simple spacing improvements

**Changes Made:**
- **Smart Revert**: Restored to latest working commit (ba970403) with all modern features
- **Space-Efficient Layout**: Reverted to compact spacing + narrower cards (CARD_WIDTH: 320→280px)
- **Foundation Preserved**: All extracted components (GoalCard, ListView, ImportExport) intact
- **Modern Features**: Menu system, celebrations, direction switching all working
- **Clean Architecture**: No collision detection complexity, just better spacing

### Lessons Learned (Product Management)
- ✅ **80/20 Rule**: Simple spacing improvements will likely solve 80% of overlap issues
- ✅ **Incremental Changes**: One change at a time prevents complexity explosion  
- ✅ **Know When to Revert**: Sometimes the best move is going back to working state
- ✅ **Wrong Problem**: Was layout issue, not collision detection issue

## 🎉 MVP COMPLETE! (9/9 Features Done)

**All core features working perfectly! Ready for Phase 2 enhancements.**

## ⏭️ Next Critical Priorities

### 🎯 IMMEDIATE: PowerPoint SmartArt Logic Fix
**Status**: 70% complete - need to perfect horizontal/vertical growth rules

**The Rule**: "Only deepest level in each branch grows vertically, all others grow horizontally"
- **Current Issue**: ID 7's children (should be deepest) growing horizontally instead of vertically
- **Root Cause**: Depth calculation not correctly identifying which level is deepest per branch
- **Fix Needed**: Correct the `isAtDeepestLevel()` logic in SimpleGoalBreaker.tsx

### 📋 Phase-by-Phase Next Steps
1. **🔴 Fix PowerPoint Logic** (1 session): Perfect deepest-level calculation algorithm
2. **🔴 Add Features One-by-One** (3-4 sessions): 
   - Add menu system → test for duplicates
   - Add celebrations → test for duplicates  
   - Add export/import → test for duplicates
   - Add canvas panning → test for duplicates
3. **🔴 Replace Main Component** (1 session): Switch from PPTGoalBreaker to SimpleGoalBreaker
4. **🔴 Clean & Deploy** (1 session): Remove debug info, polish UI, deploy bug-free version

### 🏆 Success Criteria
- ✅ Zero duplicate cards under any scenario
- ✅ Perfect PowerPoint SmartArt layout (no overlaps)
- ✅ All current features working (menu, celebrations, export)
- ✅ Professional polish (no debug text visible)
