# Development Log - Goal Breaker

## Session: September 3, 2025

### üéØ Primary Fix: Canvas Goal Positioning Layout
**Issue:** New sub-goals were overlapping and appearing in random positions
**Solution:** Implemented organizational chart-style positioning:
- Ultimate goal positioned on right side of canvas
- Sub-goals appear leftwards in columns (right‚Üíleft hierarchy)  
- Children distributed evenly around parent's vertical center
- Added `calculateChildPosition()` function for balanced spacing

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Changes Made:

**1. Modified `gridToPosition()` in `gridHelpers.ts`:**
- Changed to right-to-left layout: `x = canvasWidth - MARGIN - ((level + 1) * COLUMN_WIDTH)`
- Ultimate goal (level 0) now positions on right side

**2. Added `calculateChildPosition()` function:**
- Distributes children around parent's center point
- First child aligns with parent height
- Multiple children spread evenly above/below parent
- Prevents overlapping with intelligent spacing

**3. Updated `addSubGoal()` function:**
- Now uses `calculateChildPosition()` instead of basic grid positioning
- Gets existing siblings to calculate balanced distribution

**4. Fixed `addRootGoal()` positioning:**
- Ultimate goal appears on right side instead of center
- Maintains right-to-left organizational flow

**5. Bug Fix - Syntax Error:**
- Removed duplicate `const` keywords
- Fixed double semicolons causing compile failures

### üß™ Expected Behavior:
- Ultimate goal: Right side, vertically centered
- Level 1 goals: Left of ultimate goal, distributed vertically
- Level 2+ goals: Left of parent, evenly spaced around parent center
- Clean hierarchical flow: Right ‚Üí Left columns

### ‚úÖ Status: Ready for Testing
Need to verify positioning works correctly before moving to next bug fixes.

### üéØ Bug Fix: Task Editing Space Utilization
**Issue:** Task editing textarea only used ~50-60% of available card space, tooltip overflowed into adjacent cards
**Solution:** Optimized editing area space utilization and repositioned tooltip

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Changes Made:

**1. Enhanced Textarea Space Utilization:**
- Changed textarea height from `h-16` (64px) to `h-full` 
- Changed wrapper div to `w-full h-full` to utilize full content area
- Textarea now expands to fill available card space (card is 320x120px)

**2. Fixed Tooltip Overflow:**
- Moved tooltip from `absolute -bottom-6 left-0` to `absolute top-0 right-0`
- Added proper styling: `shadow-lg border border-gray-200 z-10`
- Tooltip now appears in top-right corner of editing area, no overflow

### üß™ Expected Results:
- Much larger editing area utilizing ~80-90% of card space
- Tooltip stays within card boundaries
- Better user experience for task editing

### ‚úÖ Status: Ready for Testing
Single change approach - test this before next modification.

### üéØ Next Priority:
Test the improved editing experience, then address other canvas bugs from backlog.
