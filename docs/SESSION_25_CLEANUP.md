## Session 25: Component Archive and Cleanup (Sept 27, 2025)

### Context and Objectives
After successful development of SimpleGoalBreaker as the primary component, performed major cleanup to remove obsolete PPTGoalBreaker components and organize the codebase.

### Components Archived
Created `src/components/__archive__/` folder and moved:
- **PPTGoalBreaker.tsx** - Old PowerPoint-style main component (replaced by SimpleGoalBreaker)
- **PPTGoalCard.tsx** - Card component for PPT version
- **GoalCard.tsx** - Original goal card (no longer used)
- **ListView.tsx** - Alternative list view (not in current design)
- **StartScreen.tsx** - Welcome screen (simplified approach now)
- **GoalBreakdown/** - Folder with older versions and backups

### Components Preserved
Kept all actively used components:
- ✅ **AppNavigation.tsx** - Menu/navigation system
- ✅ **GoalCardMenu.tsx** - Context menus
- ✅ **ImportExport.tsx** - Import/export functionality
- ✅ **LevelNavigation.tsx** - Hierarchy navigation
- ✅ **CanvasManager.tsx** - Canvas interaction handling
- ✅ **ConfettiCelebration.tsx** - Celebration animations
- ✅ **ConnectionLines.tsx** - Goal connectors (actively used)
- ✅ **SimpleGoalBreaker.tsx** - Main active component

### Helper Text System Extracted
Created `__archive__/HELPER_TEXT_EXTRACTED.tsx` with:
- Complete implementation of contextual helper text
- Keyboard shortcut display system
- Styled <kbd> tag components
- Integration instructions for SimpleGoalBreaker

### Documentation Created
- **README.md** in archive folder documenting:
  - What was archived and why
  - How to restore if needed
  - When safe to delete
  - Instructions for helper text reintegration

### Benefits
- **Cleaner Codebase**: Removed ~5 unused components
- **Clearer Intent**: Only active components in main folder
- **Preserved Knowledge**: Helper text system documented for future use
- **Easy Restoration**: Archive structure allows quick recovery if needed
- **Better Navigation**: Fewer files to wade through during development

### Technical Notes
- Used Windows `move` command for file operations
- Created archive with clear documentation
- Verified SimpleGoalBreaker only uses ConnectionLines (no broken dependencies)
- Helper text system preserved for potential future integration

### Next Steps
1. Integrate helper text system into SimpleGoalBreaker
2. Continue building out SimpleGoalBreaker features
3. After 1-2 successful deployments, consider permanently deleting archive
